Regexp serialization/deserialization

A Regexp holds a regular expression, used to match a pattern against strings.
Regexps are created using the /.../ and %r{...} literals, and by the
Regexp::new constructor.

Regular expressions (_r_e_g_e_x_ps) are patterns which describe the
contents of a string. They're used for testing whether a string contains a
given pattern, or extracting the portions that match. They are created with
the /_p_a_t/ and %r{_p_a_t} literals or the Regexp.new constructor.

A regexp is usually delimited with forward slashes (/). For example:

  /hay/ =~ 'haystack'   #=> 0
  /y/.match('haystack') #=> #<MatchData "y">

If a string contains the pattern it is said to _m_a_t_c_h. A literal
string matches itself.

Here 'haystack' does not contain the pattern 'needle', so it doesn't match:

  /needle/.match('haystack') #=> nil

Here 'haystack' contains the pattern 'hay', so it matches:

  /hay/.match('haystack')    #=> #<MatchData "hay">

Specifically, /st/ requires that the string contains the letter _s followed
by the letter _t, so it matches _h_a_y_s_t_a_c_k, also.

== ==~~  aanndd  RReeggeexxpp##mmaattcchh

Pattern matching may be achieved by using =~ operator or Regexp#match method.

=== ==~~  ooppeerraattoorr

=~ is Ruby's basic pattern-matching operator.  When one operand is a regular
expression and the other is a string then the regular expression is used as a
pattern to match against the string.  (This operator is equivalently defined
by Regexp and String so the order of String and Regexp do not matter. Other
classes may have different implementations of =~.)  If a match is found, the
operator returns index of first match in string, otherwise it returns nil.

  /hay/ =~ 'haystack'   #=> 0
  'haystack' =~ /hay/   #=> 0
  /a/   =~ 'haystack'   #=> 1
  /u/   =~ 'haystack'   #=> nil

Using =~ operator with a String and Regexp the $~ global variable is set after
a successful match.  $~ holds a MatchData object. Regexp.last_match is
equivalent to $~.

=== RReeggeexxpp##mmaattcchh  mmeetthhoodd

The #match method returns a MatchData object:

  /st/.match('haystack')   #=> #<MatchData "st">

== MMeettaacchhaarraacctteerrss  aanndd  EEssccaappeess

The following are _m_e_t_a_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s (, ), [, ], {, },
., ?, +, *. They have a specific meaning when appearing in a pattern. To match
them literally they must be backslash-escaped. To match a backslash literally
backslash-escape that: \\\\\.

  /1 \+ 2 = 3\?/.match('Does 1 + 2 = 3?') #=> #<MatchData "1 + 2 = 3?">

Patterns behave like double-quoted strings so can contain the same backslash
escapes.

  /\s\u{6771 4eac 90fd}/.match("Go to 東京都")
      #=> #<MatchData " 東京都">

Arbitrary Ruby expressions can be embedded into patterns with the #{...}
construct.

  place = "東京都"
  /#{place}/.match("Go to 東京都")
      #=> #<MatchData "東京都">

== CChhaarraacctteerr  CCllaasssseess

A _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_ _c_l_a_s_s is delimited with square
brackets ([, ]) and lists characters that may appear at that point in the
match. /[ab]/ means _a or _b, as opposed to /ab/ which means _a followed by
_b.

  /W[aeiou]rd/.match("Word") #=> #<MatchData "Word">

Within a character class the hyphen (-) is a metacharacter denoting an
inclusive range of characters. [abcd] is equivalent to [a-d]. A range can be
followed by another range, so [abcdwxyz] is equivalent to [a-dw-z]. The order
in which ranges or individual characters appear inside a character class is
irrelevant.

  /[0-9a-f]/.match('9f') #=> #<MatchData "9">
  /[9f]/.match('9f')     #=> #<MatchData "9">

If the first character of a character class is a caret (^) the class is
inverted: it matches any character _e_x_c_e_p_t those named.

  /[^a-eg-z]/.match('f') #=> #<MatchData "f">

A character class may contain another character class. By itself this isn't
useful because [a-z[0-9]] describes the same set as [a-z0-9]. However,
character classes also support the && operator which performs set intersection
on its arguments. The two can be combined as follows:

  /[a-w&&[^c-g]z]/ # ([a-w] AND ([^c-g] OR z))

This is equivalent to:

  /[abh-w]/

The following metacharacters also behave like character classes:

* /./ - Any character except a newline.
* /./m - Any character (the m modifier enables multiline mode)
* /\w/ - A word character ([a-zA-Z0-9_])
* /\W/ - A non-word character ([^a-zA-Z0-9_]). Please take a look at {Bug
  #4044}[https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4044] if using /\W/ with the /i
  modifier.
* /\d/ - A digit character ([0-9])
* /\D/ - A non-digit character ([^0-9])
* /\h/ - A hexdigit character ([0-9a-fA-F])
* /\H/ - A non-hexdigit character ([^0-9a-fA-F])
* /\s/ - A whitespace character: /[ \t\r\n\f\v]/
* /\S/ - A non-whitespace character: /[^ \t\r\n\f\v]/

POSIX _b_r_a_c_k_e_t_ _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s are also
similar to character classes. They provide a portable alternative to the
above, with the added benefit that they encompass non-ASCII characters. For
instance, /\d/ matches only the ASCII decimal digits (0-9); whereas
/[[:digit:]]/ matches any character in the Unicode _N_d category.

* /[[:alnum:]]/ - Alphabetic and numeric character
* /[[:alpha:]]/ - Alphabetic character
* /[[:blank:]]/ - Space or tab
* /[[:cntrl:]]/ - Control character
* /[[:digit:]]/ - Digit
* /[[:graph:]]/ - Non-blank character (excludes spaces, control characters,
  and similar)
* /[[:lower:]]/ - Lowercase alphabetical character
* /[[:print:]]/ - Like [:graph:], but includes the space character
* /[[:punct:]]/ - Punctuation character
* /[[:space:]]/ - Whitespace character ([:blank:], newline, carriage return,
  etc.)
* /[[:upper:]]/ - Uppercase alphabetical
* /[[:xdigit:]]/ - Digit allowed in a hexadecimal number (i.e., 0-9a-fA-F)

Ruby also supports the following non-POSIX character classes:

* /[[:word:]]/ - A character in one of the following Unicode general
  categories _L_e_t_t_e_r, _M_a_r_k, _N_u_m_b_e_r,
  _C_o_n_n_e_c_t_o_r___P_u_n_c_t_u_a_t_i_o_n
* /[[:ascii:]]/ - A character in the ASCII character set

    # U+06F2 is "EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT TWO"
    /[[:digit:]]/.match("\u06F2")    #=> #<MatchData "\u{06F2}">
    /[[:upper:]][[:lower:]]/.match("Hello") #=> #<MatchData "He">
    /[[:xdigit:]][[:xdigit:]]/.match("A6")  #=> #<MatchData "A6">

== RReeppeettiittiioonn

The constructs described so far match a single character. They can be followed
by a repetition metacharacter to specify how many times they need to occur.
Such metacharacters are called _q_u_a_n_t_i_f_i_e_r_s.

* * - Zero or more times
* + - One or more times
* ? - Zero or one times (optional)
* {_n} - Exactly _n times
* {_n,} - _n or more times
* {,_m} - _m or less times
* {_n,_m} - At least _n and at most _m times

At least one uppercase character ('H'), at least one lowercase character
('e'), two 'l' characters, then one 'o':

  "Hello".match(/[[:upper:]]+[[:lower:]]+l{2}o/) #=> #<MatchData "Hello">

Repetition is _g_r_e_e_d_y by default: as many occurrences as possible
are matched while still allowing the overall match to succeed. By contrast,
_l_a_z_y matching makes the minimal amount of matches necessary for
overall success. A greedy metacharacter can be made lazy by following it with
?.

Both patterns below match the string. The first uses a greedy quantifier so
'.+' matches '<a><b>'; the second uses a lazy quantifier so '.+?' matches
'<a>':

  /<.+>/.match("<a><b>")  #=> #<MatchData "<a><b>">
  /<.+?>/.match("<a><b>") #=> #<MatchData "<a>">

A quantifier followed by + matches _p_o_s_s_e_s_s_i_v_e_l_y: once
it has matched it does not backtrack. They behave like greedy quantifiers, but
having matched they refuse to "give up" their match even if this jeopardises
the overall match.

== CCaappttuurriinngg

Parentheses can be used for _c_a_p_t_u_r_i_n_g. The text enclosed by
the _n<sup>th</sup> group of parentheses can be subsequently referred to with
_n. Within a pattern use the _b_a_c_k_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e \n;
outside of the pattern use MatchData[_n].

'at' is captured by the first group of parentheses, then referred to later
with \1:

  /[csh](..) [csh]\1 in/.match("The cat sat in the hat")
      #=> #<MatchData "cat sat in" 1:"at">

Regexp#match returns a MatchData object which makes the captured text
available with its #[] method:

  /[csh](..) [csh]\1 in/.match("The cat sat in the hat")[1] #=> 'at'

Capture groups can be referred to by name when defined with the
(?<_n_a_m_e>) or (?'_n_a_m_e') constructs.

  /\$(?<dollars>\d+)\.(?<cents>\d+)/.match("$3.67")
      => #<MatchData "$3.67" dollars:"3" cents:"67">
  /\$(?<dollars>\d+)\.(?<cents>\d+)/.match("$3.67")[:dollars] #=> "3"

Named groups can be backreferenced with \k<_n_a_m_e>, where _n_a_m_e
is the group name.

  /(?<vowel>[aeiou]).\k<vowel>.\k<vowel>/.match('ototomy')
      #=> #<MatchData "ototo" vowel:"o">

NNoottee: A regexp can't use named backreferences and numbered
backreferences simultaneously.

When named capture groups are used with a literal regexp on the left-hand side
of an expression and the =~ operator, the captured text is also assigned to
local variables with corresponding names.

  /\$(?<dollars>\d+)\.(?<cents>\d+)/ =~ "$3.67" #=> 0
  dollars #=> "3"

== GGrroouuppiinngg

Parentheses also _g_r_o_u_p the terms they enclose, allowing them to be
quantified as one _a_t_o_m_i_c whole.

The pattern below matches a vowel followed by 2 word characters:

  /[aeiou]\w{2}/.match("Caenorhabditis elegans") #=> #<MatchData "aen">

Whereas the following pattern matches a vowel followed by a word character,
twice, i.e. [aeiou]\w[aeiou]\w: 'enor'.

  /([aeiou]\w){2}/.match("Caenorhabditis elegans")
      #=> #<MatchData "enor" 1:"or">

The (?:...) construct provides grouping without capturing. That is, it
combines the terms it contains into an atomic whole without creating a
backreference. This benefits performance at the slight expense of readability.

The first group of parentheses captures 'n' and the second 'ti'. The second
group is referred to later with the backreference \2:

  /I(n)ves(ti)ga\2ons/.match("Investigations")
      #=> #<MatchData "Investigations" 1:"n" 2:"ti">

The first group of parentheses is now made non-capturing with '?:', so it
still matches 'n', but doesn't create the backreference. Thus, the
backreference \1 now refers to 'ti'.

  /I(?:n)ves(ti)ga\1ons/.match("Investigations")
      #=> #<MatchData "Investigations" 1:"ti">

=== AAttoommiicc  GGrroouuppiinngg

Grouping can be made _a_t_o_m_i_c with (?>_p_a_t). This causes the
subexpression _p_a_t to be matched independently of the rest of the
expression such that what it matches becomes fixed for the remainder of the
match, unless the entire subexpression must be abandoned and subsequently
revisited. In this way _p_a_t is treated as a non-divisible whole. Atomic
grouping is typically used to optimise patterns so as to prevent the regular
expression engine from backtracking needlessly.

The " in the pattern below matches the first character of the string, then .*
matches _Q_u_o_t_e_". This causes the overall match to fail, so the text
matched by .* is backtracked by one position, which leaves the final character
of the string available to match "

  /".*"/.match('"Quote"')     #=> #<MatchData "\"Quote\"">

If .* is grouped atomically, it refuses to backtrack _Q_u_o_t_e_", even
though this means that the overall match fails

  /"(?>.*)"/.match('"Quote"') #=> nil

== SSuubbeexxpprreessssiioonn  CCaallllss

The \g<_n_a_m_e> syntax matches the previous subexpression named
_n_a_m_e, which can be a group name or number, again. This differs from
backreferences in that it re-executes the group rather than simply trying to
re-match the same text.

This pattern matches a _( character and assigns it to the paren group, tries
to call that the paren sub-expression again but fails, then matches a literal
_):

  /\A(?<paren>\(\g<paren>*\))*\z/ =~ '()'

  /\A(?<paren>\(\g<paren>*\))*\z/ =~ '(())' #=> 0
  # ^1
  #      ^2
  #           ^3
  #                 ^4
  #      ^5
  #           ^6
  #                      ^7
  #                       ^8
  #                       ^9
  #                           ^10

1. Matches at the beginning of the string, i.e. before the first character.
2. Enters a named capture group called paren
3. Matches a literal _(, the first character in the string
4. Calls the paren group again, i.e. recurses back to the second step
5. Re-enters the paren group
6. Matches a literal _(, the second character in the string
7. Try to call paren a third time, but fail because doing so would prevent an
   overall successful match
8. Match a literal _), the third character in the string. Marks the end of
   the second recursive call
9. Match a literal _), the fourth character in the string
10. Match the end of the string

== AAlltteerrnnaattiioonn

The vertical bar metacharacter (|) combines two expressions into a single one
that matches either of the expressions. Each expression is an
_a_l_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_v_e.

  /\w(and|or)\w/.match("Feliformia") #=> #<MatchData "form" 1:"or">
  /\w(and|or)\w/.match("furandi")    #=> #<MatchData "randi" 1:"and">
  /\w(and|or)\w/.match("dissemblance") #=> nil

All character properties can be inverted by prefixing their name with a caret
(^).

Letter 'A' is not in the Unicode Ll (Letter; Lowercase) category, so this
match succeeds:

  /\p{^Ll}/.match("A") #=> #<MatchData "A">

Anchors are metacharacter that match the zero-width positions between
characters, _a_n_c_h_o_r_i_n_g the match to a specific position.

* ^ - Matches beginning of line
* $ - Matches end of line
* \A - Matches beginning of string.
* \Z - Matches end of string. If string ends with a newline, it matches just
  before newline
* \z - Matches end of string
* \G - Matches point where last match finished
* \b - Matches word boundaries when outside brackets; backspace (0x08) when
  inside brackets
* \B - Matches non-word boundaries
* (?=_p_a_t) - _P_o_s_i_t_i_v_e_ _l_o_o_k_a_h_e_a_d
  assertion: ensures that the following characters match _p_a_t, but
  doesn't include those characters in the matched text
* (?!_p_a_t) - _N_e_g_a_t_i_v_e_ _l_o_o_k_a_h_e_a_d
  assertion: ensures that the following characters do not match _p_a_t, but
  doesn't include those characters in the matched text
* (?<=_p_a_t) - _P_o_s_i_t_i_v_e_ _l_o_o_k_b_e_h_i_n_d
  assertion: ensures that the preceding characters match _p_a_t, but
  doesn't include those characters in the matched text
* (?<!_p_a_t) - _N_e_g_a_t_i_v_e_ _l_o_o_k_b_e_h_i_n_d
  assertion: ensures that the preceding characters do not match _p_a_t, but
  doesn't include those characters in the matched text

If a pattern isn't anchored it can begin at any point in the string:

  /real/.match("surrealist") #=> #<MatchData "real">

Anchoring the pattern to the beginning of the string forces the match to start
there. 'real' doesn't occur at the beginning of the string, so now the match
fails:

  /\Areal/.match("surrealist") #=> nil

The match below fails because although 'Demand' contains 'and', the pattern
does not occur at a word boundary.

  /\band/.match("Demand")

Whereas in the following example 'and' has been anchored to a non-word
boundary so instead of matching the first 'and' it matches from the fourth
letter of 'demand' instead:

  /\Band.+/.match("Supply and demand curve") #=> #<MatchData "and curve">

The pattern below uses positive lookahead and positive lookbehind to match
text appearing in  tags without including the tags in the match:

  /(?<=<b>)\w+(?=<\/b>)/.match("Fortune favours the <b>bold</b>")
      #=> #<MatchData "bold">

== OOppttiioonnss

The end delimiter for a regexp can be followed by one or more single-letter
options which control how the pattern can match.

* /pat/i - Ignore case
* /pat/m - Treat a newline as a character matched by .
* /pat/x - Ignore whitespace and comments in the pattern
* /pat/o - Perform #{} interpolation only once

i, m, and x can also be applied on the subexpression level with the
(?_o_n-_o_f_f) construct, which enables options _o_n, and disables
options _o_f_f for the expression enclosed by the parentheses.

  /a(?i:b)c/.match('aBc') #=> #<MatchData "aBc">
  /a(?i:b)c/.match('abc') #=> #<MatchData "abc">

Options may also be used with Regexp.new:

  Regexp.new("abc", Regexp::IGNORECASE)                     #=> /abc/i
  Regexp.new("abc", Regexp::MULTILINE)                      #=> /abc/m
  Regexp.new("abc # Comment", Regexp::EXTENDED)             #=> /abc # Comment/x
  Regexp.new("abc", Regexp::IGNORECASE | Regexp::MULTILINE) #=> /abc/mi

As mentioned above, the x option enables _f_r_e_e_-_s_p_a_c_i_n_g
mode. Literal white space inside the pattern is ignored, and the octothorpe
(#) character introduces a comment until the end of the line. This allows the
components of the pattern to be organized in a potentially more readable
fashion.

A contrived pattern to match a number with optional decimal places:

  float_pat = /\A
      [[:digit:]]+ # 1 or more digits before the decimal point
      (\.          # Decimal point
          [[:digit:]]+ # 1 or more digits after the decimal point
      )? # The decimal point and following digits are optional
  \Z/x
  float_pat.match('3.14') #=> #<MatchData "3.14" 1:".14">

There are a number of strategies for matching whitespace:

* Use a pattern such as \s or \p{Space}.
* Use escaped whitespace such as \ , i.e. a space preceded by a backslash.
* Use a character class such as [ ].

Comments can be included in a non-x pattern with the (?#_c_o_m_m_e_n_t)
construct, where _c_o_m_m_e_n_t is arbitrary text ignored by the regexp
engine.

Comments in regexp literals cannot include unescaped terminator characters.

== EEnnccooddiinngg

Regular expressions are assumed to use the source encoding. This can be
overridden with one of the following modifiers.

* /_p_a_t/u - UTF-8
* /_p_a_t/e - EUC-JP
* /_p_a_t/s - Windows-31J
* /_p_a_t/n - ASCII-8BIT

A regexp can be matched against a string when they either share an encoding,
or the regexp's encoding is _U_S_-_A_S_C_I_I and the string's encoding
is ASCII-compatible.

If a match between incompatible encodings is attempted an
Encoding::CompatibilityError exception is raised.

The Regexp#fixed_encoding? predicate indicates whether the regexp has a
_f_i_x_e_d encoding, that is one incompatible with ASCII. A regexp's
encoding can be explicitly fixed by supplying Regexp::FIXEDENCODING as the
second argument of Regexp.new:

  r = Regexp.new("a".force_encoding("iso-8859-1"),Regexp::FIXEDENCODING)
  r =~"a\u3042"
     #=> Encoding::CompatibilityError: incompatible encoding regexp match
          (ISO-8859-1 regexp with UTF-8 string)

Pattern matching sets some global variables :
* $~ is equivalent to Regexp.last_match;
* $& contains the complete matched text;
* $` contains string before match;
* $' contains string after match;
* $1, $2 and so on contain text matching first, second, etc capture group;
* $+ contains last capture group.

Example:

  m = /s(\w{2}).*(c)/.match('haystack') #=> #<MatchData "stac" 1:"ta" 2:"c">
  $~                                    #=> #<MatchData "stac" 1:"ta" 2:"c">
  Regexp.last_match                     #=> #<MatchData "stac" 1:"ta" 2:"c">

  $&      #=> "stac"
          # same as m[0]
  $`      #=> "hay"
          # same as m.pre_match
  $'      #=> "k"
          # same as m.post_match
  $1      #=> "ta"
          # same as m[1]
  $2      #=> "c"
          # same as m[2]
  $3      #=> nil
          # no third group in pattern
  $+      #=> "c"
          # same as m[-1]

These global variables are thread-local and method-local variables.

Certain pathological combinations of constructs can lead to abysmally bad
performance.

Consider a string of 25 _as, a _d, 4 _as, and a _c.

  s = 'a' * 25 + 'd' + 'a' * 4 + 'c'
  #=> "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadaaaac"

The following patterns match instantly as you would expect:

  /(b|a)/ =~ s #=> 0
  /(b|a+)/ =~ s #=> 0
  /(b|a+)*/ =~ s #=> 0

However, the following pattern takes appreciably longer:

  /(b|a+)*c/ =~ s #=> 26

This happens because an atom in the regexp is quantified by both an immediate
+ and an enclosing * with nothing to differentiate which is in control of any
particular character. The nondeterminism that results produces super-linear
performance. (Consult _M_a_s_t_e_r_i_n_g_ _R_e_g_u_l_a_r_
_E_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s (3rd ed.), pp 222, by
_J_e_f_f_e_r_y_ _F_r_i_e_d_l, for an in-depth analysis). This
particular case can be fixed by use of atomic grouping, which prevents the
unnecessary backtracking:

  (start = Time.now) && /(b|a+)*c/ =~ s && (Time.now - start)
     #=> 24.702736882
  (start = Time.now) && /(?>b|a+)*c/ =~ s && (Time.now - start)
     #=> 0.000166571

A similar case is typified by the following example, which takes approximately
60 seconds to execute for me:

Match a string of 29 _as against a pattern of 29 optional _as followed by 29
mandatory _as:

  Regexp.new('a?' * 29 + 'a' * 29) =~ 'a' * 29

The 29 optional _as match the string, but this prevents the 29 mandatory _as
that follow from matching. Ruby must then backtrack repeatedly so as to
satisfy as many of the optional matches as it can while still matching the
mandatory 29. It is plain to us that none of the optional matches can succeed,
but this fact unfortunately eludes Ruby.

The best way to improve performance is to significantly reduce the amount of
backtracking needed.  For this case, instead of individually matching 29
optional _as, a range of optional _as can be matched all at once with
_a_{_0_,_2_9_}:

  Regexp.new('a{0,29}' + 'a' * 29) =~ 'a' * 29
